		- now working on this

	  - Fixed the prolem with SDL2.dll (add a copy command to the editor CMake file). 
	  - TODO: propagate masks to an entire folder

	- Solved the multiple masks problems, the first is the best
	- Refactoring: created the "common" library
	- PROBLEM: The FindSDL... does not work in Macos (removing it solves the problem but need to a solution that also works for windows)
	- PROBLEM: Trying to put stb_image... within common

19/07/2024
	- All previous problems solved
	- TODO: Time to integrate into the editor
	- TODO: Need refactoring cli_masks and everything before

	- editor: Load video ok
	- PROBLEM: (editor) Currently the image is displayed at 0,0 of the main window, this is why the compute_masks work. But it should be displayed within the visible window and the clicked point recomputed
