													back2black Developer's Manual 

1. Building 

1.1 Prerequisites

- The opencv repo should be located within the same folder that contains this repo's root folder. OpenCV should be built statically within the opencv/build folder (see ANNEX 1)
	
	|- some_folder
		|- back2black
		|- opencv
			|- build

1.2 Building

NOTE: The -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF flag makes excutable bigger but independent

From the root of the repo (better):

	cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -B build_macos -S .
	cmake --build build_macos

From the build_macos:

	cd dev/build_macos
	cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF ..
	cmake --build .

2. Testing

From the root of the repo:

	./build_macos/bin/editor

	./build_macos/bin/cli -t 16 -i ./img.jpg -m ./checkpoints/ggml-model-f16.bin

	./build_macos/bin/test_opencv

From the build_macos folder:

	./bin/editor

	./bin/cli -t 16 -i ../img.jpg -m ../checkpoints/ggml-model-f16.bin

	./bin/test_opencv


3. Troubleshooting

TIP: Cannot copy the OpenCV "build" folder to a different place as there are paths within the cmake related files.

TIP: Inspecting cmake variables

	include(CMakePrintHelpers)
	cmake_print_variables(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})


ANNEX 1. OpenCV

Clone OpenCV repo in an independent location

	git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git

Compile OpenCV without dynamic libraries (advice: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Compact-build-advice)

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF ..
	cmake --build .

When linking your app, use this:

	set(EXAMPLE_TARGET test_opencv)
	...
	set(OpenCV_DIR "/Users/rtous/dev/opencv/build")
	find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED) 
	target_link_libraries(${EXAMPLE_TARGET} PRIVATE ${OpenCV_LIBS} ${CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT})
